<h4>Once upon a time..</h4>
<p>..there was a man with an idea and a company willingess to realise this idea.</p>
<p>The project started early 2013 as a coorporation between IceFlag and Greenpeace. Iceflag is a coorporation specialised in human resources software developed whereas Greenpeace has an excellent taste for awesome software.</p>

<h5>Philosophy</h5>
<p>Current human resource (HR) systems are often expensive and needs to licensed in order to use it. Often this results in over-priced software which is mostly focused on automating HR rather than sharing some love. A company often needs only a part of you, for example, your awesome marketing skils. This is what we call a human resource. However often there is a person (with its owm personality) attached to it. This makes it hard to manage. Should we manage only the human resource? Or should we manage the person as a whole? This is often the question organisations are struggeling with. Blue Robin aims to bring in the human site in a software systems by providing a tool rather than a management system. We believe the HR manage is the expert in managing the human resource and person. Blue Robin aims to support the HR manager by providing tools which he/she can use to forefill the daily HR practises.</p>

<h5>Values</h5>
<p>The project is founded on the following values:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Knowledge-sharing</li>
  <li>Work/life balance</li>
  <li>Positive approach</li>
  <li>Passion for HR</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to communicate those values because you will find them back in the software functions.</p>

<h5>The added value for you as an organisation</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Entry barrier</li>
  <li>Open-source/sustainability</li>
  <li>Customisation</li>
  <li>Ownership</li>
</ol>



<h5>Entry barrier</h5>
<p>By providing a free software the Blue Robin project lowers the entry barrier for organisations to use Blue Robin. Therefore from a financial point of view Blue Robin becomes an interesting piece of art for an organisation to consider.</p>

<h5>Open-source + sustainability</h5>
<p>The software, Blue Robin, contains a MIT license which allows free usage. The aim is to share the software all across the world in order to establish world-wide acceptance. The strenght of open-source project is that fact that everyone with mad skillz can join the project and improve it. The Blue Robin project aims to reach out to those developers. For you, this means that your own IT experts can also participate in the project. A better and faster software is in best interest of all parties.</p>

<h5>Customisation</h5>
<p>Once you have downloaded the source code you will be able to adjust the software according to your own needs. In this way, the software will always fit your organisation. Once you have made your awesome changes we hope that you are willing to share those. If it is a great change, we can include it in the next release to make the software even more amazing.</p>

<h5>Ownership</h5>
<p>Since you own the software (source-code), you (as an organisation) are not dependent on the financial continuity of any organisation. Whereas before, you are dependent on the position and resources of the organisation you license the software from, you are the owner of Blue Robin. Therefore you will be able to run it within your own server and your own IT experts will be to sustain it.</p>
<p>Like stated in the open-source section. Everybody is owner of the Blue Robin project and therefore everyone with development skills can improve the software. Over time you will see that this will benefit your organisation, the project and the community. An excellent example of a succesfull open-source project is Ubuntu, which is a Linux operating system.</p>
